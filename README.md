### **_*Description*_**

#### This project is centered on creating a matching pairs game. The Matching Pairs game integrates several programming concepts through the utilization of foundational programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Programming concepts illustrated include understanding of scope, function parameters, events listeners, and proper syntax and well -organized code. This project ultimately delivers an accessible and interactive game while demonstrating an understanding of introductory programming languages and their relationships.

### **_Getting Started_**

#### Players are presented with eight face-down cards and are tasked with finding four matching pairs of cards. By clicking on a face down card, players reveal the colored side of the card. The player can then flip a second card over in attempts to find a match. If the two cards do not match, they will flip back to face-down. If the cards match, they will be deactivated from the board. The player then continues to try to find the remaining matches. This is a one player game where the gamer tries to complete the game as fast as they can against a timer.
