      <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
      <p>Players are presented with eight face-down cards and are tasked with finding four matching pairs of cards. By clicking on a face down card, players reveal the colored side of the card. The player can then flip a second card over in attempts to find a match. If the two cards do not match, they will flip back to face-down. If the cards match, they will be deactivated from the board. The player then continues to try to find the remaining matches. This is a one player game where the gamer tries to complete the game as fast as they can against a timer.</p>
